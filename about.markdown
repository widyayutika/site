My name is Widya Tantiya Yutika, an inspiring data analyst with engineering background.

Having initially worked as civil engineer who designed building for 2 years, I made a pivotal decision to pursue a career switch through a Technology in Finance Immersion Programme (TFIP) in December 2021. Through this programme, I completed a 6-month structural training for data analytics and a on-the-job training in J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. as Technology Operations Application Support. Although the role was not the exact fit for my aspirations, it provided valuable insights and skills. My determination to pursue a data analyst position remains unwavering, and I am committed to leverage my acquired data analytics skills to make meaningful contributions in the field.

Currently, I am furthering my expertise by pursuing a Master of IT in Business degree in Singapore Management University(SMU), majoring in Analytics Technology and Applications, aiming to delves deeper into the complexities of data analytics.
