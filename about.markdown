I am an aspiring Data Analyst, keen in applying data-driven approach to develop models that address business problems. With over 2 years of experience in construction industry as civil engineer and 1 year experience in application support within the banking sector, I possess strong analytical thinking, problem solving, and stakeholder management skills. I thrive both independently and as a part of a team.

Having initially worked as civil engineer who designed building for 2 years, I made a pivotal decision to pursue a career switch through a Technology in Finance Immersion Programme (TFIP) in December 2021. Through this programme, I completed a 6-month structural training for data analytics and a on-the-job training in J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. as Technology Operations Application Support. Although the role was not the exact fit for my aspirations, it provided valuable insights and skills. My determination to pursue a data analyst position remains unwavering, and I am committed to leverage my acquired data analytics skills to make meaningful contributions in the field.

Recently, I successfully completed my Master of IT in Business degree at Singapore Management University (SMU), majoring in Analytics Technology and Applications. This intensive program has equipped me with advanced skills and knowledge in data analytics, preparing me to tackle complex business challenges using data-driven approaches. I am now enthusiastic about leveraging my diverse background, coupled with my newfound expertise in data analytics, to excel in a dynamic role as a Data Analyst and drive impactful business outcomes.
